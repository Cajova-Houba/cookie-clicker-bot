# Cookie clicker bot
This is a simple bot for cookie clicker game: http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/

Reason why I decided to make this simple script is to learn. I did not want to cheat
or win by cheating (is it even possible to win this game?).

## Description
The bot's logic is rather easy. It clicks on the cookie and then checks if there's any good building to buy.

The bot uses both inner game obejcts and DOM elements.

## Installation
To run this bot, you need some tool to inject your own java script to webpage. 
I'm using firefox and this extension: https://mybrowseraddon.com/custom-style-script.html
